<h2>Comprehension</h2>
<p>I am very good at getting up to speed with new projects and technologies. Part of the reason for this is my experience, the more projects and technologies you work on/with the better you get at extrapolating into new situations. Another basis for my ability is a keen sense of when I don't fully understand something and no qualms with asking questions and/or researching until I do.</p>

<p>Two examples from my last role serve well to highlight my ability. Firstly, originally hired primarily for my PHP development skills in my last role when I actually started I found that there had been a change of plan and that I was put onto a project that, while it involved some PHP, was principally about a producing a music streaming web application. This meant the primary focus was on Flash and a heavy amount of Javascript. At the time my JavaScript knowledge was mainly limited to using Jquery for simple interactions and my opinion was that a lot of the language seemed generally a bit broken.</p>

<p>However this was a good opportunity to improve my ability with Javascript which I promptly set about doing. I was also lucky enough to work with a colleague who was (and indeed continues to be) very proficient with JavaScript. He pointed me to a few key pieces of literature as well as providing code reviews and pairing in a mentoring sense. I learnt that while parts of JavaScript are indeed broken, if you avoid using them and focus on the good bits it is a nice language to work with. Six months later we had hit our target of building a proof of concept that would be turned into a product that was rolled out to over 35 territories world wide.</p>

<p>The second example is the integration of a payment processing service which was managed by a division of the company that was based in the United States of America. The service had just been transitioned to the U.S. division and the new team were still learning how it was put together. Unfortunately this coincided with my teams hard deadline for completion of the integration. With strong collaboration with my colleagues in the U.S., enabled by some great work by project managers on both sides, we started to make progress. This culminated in a colleague and myself from the UK office flying out to the U.S. to complete the integration on site. We had four days to complete which, after pulling some long hours, I'm pleased to say we achieved. Key to this success was my ability to quickly get a handle on how the payment service worked so that I could help my American colleagues identify what needed to be done, help with some of the changes and confirm when parts of the integration had been successful. To this end I was given access to their source code repository and quickly conducted an audit of the code to identify the key sticking points that were being experienced. The service was based on JavaServer Pages, which is not a technology I have spent much time with but I was still able to build up a high level picture of how the service operated.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>I have a strong sense of where a product I'm working on is heading and the healthiness of its code base. This enables me to recommend courses of action that solve many problems at the most cost effective point, before they've happened.</p>

<h2>Drive</h2>
<p>I work on software products because I'm excited about what they are going to achieve. This means I don't see the development process as an end unto itself. It is a process with a distinct goal, to produce a product on time and on budget that consumers love and achieves the businesses aims.</p>

<h2>Pragmatism</h2>
<p>The world is not a perfect place and compromises frequently have to be made to achieve business goals on time and within budget. As such I will take the approach that works well enough over the one that is 100% theoretically sound but can't be delivered on time. This is often a delicate balancing act in practice though, especially in software projects.<p>

<p>In my direct experience any short cuts taken to hit a tactical goal, say a demo to an investor, usually cost more to fix than going straight to a production quality solution. A good rule of thumb is a 2-to-1 ratio, i.e. taking a short cut and then retrofitting something fit for a production environment will cost twice as much as going straight to the production quality solution. This is assuming that the retrofit happens straight away, the more work that is done on top of a short cut the more the cost increases. This is the nasty reality of technical debt.</p>

<p>So, sometimes pragmatism is saying no to a short cut because the cost further down the line is going to be too high which ultimately can result in a project being kicked into touch. Being able to tell the difference between an affordable short cut and one which is likely to start rotting a project from the inside out is something that I have only gained after years of experience in the industry.</p>

<h2>Affable</h2>
<ul><li>Friendly</li><li>Good-Natured</li><li>Communicative</li></ul>
<p>I get on well with others and am always willing to help someone out, current work commitments permitting. This means I am comfortable approaching and collaborating with others. In the software world this usually takes the form of presentations, group discussions, code reviews, pairing, recruiting, mentoring and asking the occasional stupid question.</p>

<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>I have held a senior position for a number of years now and particularly in my last role provided technical leadership within my team. This took a number of forms including conducting research into new technology and approaches, providing support to less experienced members of the team, taking part in the recruitment of new staff and when there wasn't a strong group consensus making a call and shouldering the responsibility for its success or failure.</p>

<p>Having talked to a number of ex-colleagues since I left my last role it seems that one of the most important things I brought was clarity, direction and pragmatic compromise to situations where there was not necessarily a clear cut answer to a problem.</p>
